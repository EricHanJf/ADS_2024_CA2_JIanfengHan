# Algorithms and Data Structures 'CA2'

## Overview

- This project is divided into two parts. The first part is a dictionary-like program implemented by TreeMap, BinaryTree and BSTNode. When the user enters the first letter of a word (for example, 'a'), it will find all the words starting with the letter "a" in Dictionary.txt and print them out.
- The second program is the Books software, which allows users to manage book collections. It provides the ability to load book data from CSV files, filter books by various requirements (such as price), and sort books based on different attributes (such as title, author, and publication year).

## Features

- Load book data from a CSV file.
- Filter books by price range.
- Sort books by title, author, publication year, and genre.
- Unit test using Google Test framework to verify functionality.
